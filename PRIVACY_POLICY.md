# Privacy Policy for DocTell

_Last updated: 2025-12-09_

DocTell ("the App") is developed by Ekroth Dev ("the Developer").  
This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data and protects your privacy.

DocTell is a tool for reading and listening to PDF documents using Text-to-Speech (TTS).  
Your PDF files and their contents always remain on your device and are never uploaded.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. PDF Files (Local Only)
- The App accesses PDF files **only when you manually choose a file**.
- The App never scans your device automatically.
- Your PDF files are **never uploaded** or shared anywhere.

### b. Reading Progress & Bookmarks (Local Only)
- Saving your reading position and bookmarks happens **only on your device**.

### c. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- The App uses your device’s built-in TTS engine.
- Processing is done **offline on your device** unless your TTS engine requires internet.
- DocTell does not upload spoken text to the Developer.

### d. Anonymous Usage Statistics (Firebase Analytics)
To improve stability and usability, the App collects anonymous usage statistics, such as:
- Screen views (e.g., Reader screen)
- Feature usage (e.g., starting or pausing TTS)
- Page navigation events (e.g., next page, previous page)
- General device data (device model, OS version, country)
  
No PDF content, file names, or personally identifiable information is collected.
You may disable analytics at any time in the App settings.

### e. Crash Reports (Firebase Crashlytics)
To diagnose technical issues, the App may collect:
- Anonymous crash logs
- Error messages
- Device/OS information
Crash reports never include your PDF content or personal files.

### f. Permissions Used
The App may request:
- **Read external storage** — needed to open PDF files
- **Internet** — used only for optional analytics & crash reporting, and for certain TTS engines

The App does **not** request access to:
- Microphone  
- Camera  
- Contacts  
- Location  

---

### 2. User Consent
When launching the App for the first time, you may be asked whether you want to enable anonymous usage statistics.
- If you decline, analytics data will not be collected.
- Crash reporting may still collect strictly technical information needed to fix app crashes, but no document content is ever included.

## 3. Data Sharing
DocTell does ***not*** sell or share personal data.
For analytics and crash reporting, DocTell uses:

- Google Firebase Analytics (anonymous usage statistics)
- Google Firebase Crashlytics (crash diagnostics)
  
These services process data on secure Google servers.
### No PDF content, personal identifiers, or document data are ever shared.

---

## 4. Open-Source Transparency
Parts of DocTell may be open source.  
Source code stored on GitHub or other platforms **never includes any user data**.

User files, bookmarks or reading activity are **not uploaded** anywhere and cannot appear in the code repository.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
The App does not collect personal information from users of any age.  
It is safe for general audiences, including children.

---

## 6. Security
DocTell is designed so that your PDF documents and their contents remain fully local on your device.

The Developer cannot access:
- Your documents
- Your extracted text  
- Your reading progress
- Your bookmarks

Only anonymous analytics or crash information may be processed by Google Firebase.
