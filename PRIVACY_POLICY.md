All processing happens **locally on your device**.

The App only uses the following data locally:

- No data is transferred outside your device.

### c. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- The App uses your device’s built-in TTS engine.
- Processing is done **offline on your device** unless your TTS engine requires internet.
- The App itself does not send TTS data anywhere.

### d. Permissions Used
The App may request:
- **Read external storage** — needed to open PDF files
- **Internet** — currently unused, but may be required for future optional features

The App does **not** request access to:
- Microphone  
- Camera
